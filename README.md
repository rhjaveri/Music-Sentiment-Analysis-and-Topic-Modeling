Languages Used: Python, MySQL

In this project, I attempt to understand the core ideas that have driven popular music over the past 50 years as well as how sentiment has shifted over time. 

In the first part of the project, I perform Topic Modeling on the archived BillBoard data using an LDA Model, Tfidf, and other processing techniques.

In the second part of the project, I used previously labelled data to train a shallow binary classification neural network using the processed lyrics as the input. I used this model to predict the positivity/negativity of the BillBoard archived music and plot how sentiment has shifted over time in mainstream music.
